/*The MySQL LAG() and LEAD() value window functions can 
have a second argument, designating how many rows/steps 
back (for LAG()) or forth (for LEAD()) we'd like to refer 
to with respect to a given record.

With that in mind, create a query whose result set contains 
data arranged by the salary values associated to each employee 
number (in ascending order). Let the output contain the following six columns:

- the employee number

- the salary value of an employee's contract 
 (i.e. which weâ€™ll consider as the employee's current salary)

- the employee's previous salary

- the employee's contract salary value preceding their previous salary

- the employee's next salary

- the employee's contract salary value subsequent to their next salary

Restrict the output to the first 1000 records you can obtain. */
